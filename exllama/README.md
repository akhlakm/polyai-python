This is a clone of https://github.com/turboderp/exllama.
The scripts have been converted into a module by adding an `__init__.py` file
and using relative imports.

- To update to the latest version, copy the files from the original repo and update into relative imports.
- The `__init__.py` file should be kept unchanged.
- A `__main__.py` has been added for testing purposes, which can be run as `python -m exllama`.
